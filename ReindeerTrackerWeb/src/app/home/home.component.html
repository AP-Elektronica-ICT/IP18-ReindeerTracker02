  <h1>What is ReindeerFinder?</h1>
  <p>
    ReindeerFinder is an IoT device developed by the University of Applied Scineces of Oulu in co√∂peration with AP University from antwerp.
    The product gives farmers the opertunity to find their animal if they were attacked in an unknown area and retreive them.
    A tracker is attached to the animal and when it senses that it is dead it will send it's current location so the owner can locate their corpses in hope of getting a compensation.
